Don't worry if what is written in the code cell makes no sense to you. That's what you'll be learning in this course ðŸ™‚\n",

To do so, simply click 'Sign in' in the top right corner of this page, then 'Create account', and follow the prompts to create an account.\n",

It may take a moment to run it, but you should see a helicopter below it once its done. Use your mouse to move the helicopter around and see it from all sides."
